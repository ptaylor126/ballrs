# Ballrs - Project Overview

## What is Ballrs?

Ballrs is a multi-sport player guessing game. Users guess a mystery player based on hints revealed through their guesses. Think Wordle meets sports trivia.

## Core Concept

- Each day, there's a new mystery player to guess
- Users type a player's name as their guess
- The app shows how each stat compares to the mystery player (match, close, or wrong)
- Users use these clues to narrow down and find the correct player
- Fewer guesses = better score
